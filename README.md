# Simpified-Simple-Direct-Lay
my goal is to internalise the operations by making a simplified sdl wrapper for new comers 
  - avoid pointers as much as possible
  - avoid rudimentary linking such as screen variables 
  - create an application with a single application object with internalised functions 
    - screen state management  
    - sprite management
    - auto updates
    - auto fliping
    -
